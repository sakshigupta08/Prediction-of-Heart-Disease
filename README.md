-Pandas-->The pandas package is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today. The powerful machine learning and glamorous visualization tools may get all the attention, but pandas is the backbone of most data projects.Pandas is one of the tools in Machine Learning which is used for data cleaning and analysis. It has features which are used for exploring, cleaning, transforming and visualizing from data.
-Numpy-->NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely. NumPy stands for Numerical Python. In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy. Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.
-Matpltlib-->Matplotlib is an amazing visualization library in Python for 2D plots of arrays. Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. Matplotlib comes with a wide variety of plots. Plots helps to understand trends, patterns, and to make correlations. They’re typically instruments for reasoning about quantitative information.
-Warnings-->Warning messages are typically issued in situations where it is useful to alert the user of some condition in a program, where that condition (normally) doesn’t warrant raising an exception and terminating the program. For example, one might want to issue a warning when a program uses an obsolete module. Python programmers issue warnings by calling the warn() function defined in this module.

Here, we will be using 3 algorithms:
1.KNeighborsClassifier
2.DecisionTreeClassifier
3.RandomForestClassifier

# Categorical Variable
A categorical variable (sometimes called a nominal variable) is one that has two or more categories, but there is no intrinsic ordering to the categories.
